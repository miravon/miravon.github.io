# Hi, I'm Md. Kauser Mahmud

I'm a higher secondary student at **Notre Dame College**. I’m really into **Computer Science** and **Maths**, and I enjoy exploring all sorts of ideas just for fun.  

I’m currently an **executive at the Notre Dame Math Club** and also contribute to **graphic design projects**.  

In my free time, I love **physics, reading**, and creating things.
