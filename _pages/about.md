Hi, I'm Md. Kauser Mahmud, a Computer Science and Math enthusiast, and I love exploring these fields and learning new things along the way.  

I’m currently a higher secondary student at Notre Dame College. I also serve as an executive at the Notre Dame Math Club and contribute to graphic design projects.  

In my free time, I enjoy reading, watching films, solving physics problems and creating things.
