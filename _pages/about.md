Hi, I'm Md. Kauser Mahmud, a **Computer Science** and **Math enthusiast**, and I love exploring these fields and learning new things along the way.  

I’m currently a higher secondary student at Notre Dame College. I also serve as an executive at Notre Dame Math Club and contribute to graphic design projects.  

In my free time, I enjoy *reading, watching films, solving physics problems* and *creating things*. That's all for now I guess :))
